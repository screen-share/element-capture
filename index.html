      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Pre-existing mechanisms such as {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} allow Web applications to
        initiate screen-capture. If the user chooses to capture a tab, mechanisms such as
        [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] mutate the resulting video track and perform an
        operation on all subsequent frames produced. (In the example of [[mediacapture-region|Region
        Capture]], the operation consists of cropping frames to the frame's intersection with the
        bounding box of a target-element.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Element Capture introduces a new mutation mechanism which we name "restriction". When an
        application "restricts" a video track to a given target-element, frames produced on the
        restricted video track only consist of information from the target-element and its
        descendants. Phrased differently, the track becomes a capture of the DOM sub-tree rooted at
        the target-element.

        <h3>Generic Use-Case</h3>
        <p>
          [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] allows applications to crop captures. Assume some
          element <code>TARGET</code> is the restriction-target. What if other elements, which are
          not DOM-descendants of <code>TARGET</code>, draw in front of <code>TARGET</code>? Using
          [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]], these other elements would also get captured,
          which is not always desirable. A mechanism is sought that would allow cropping to
          <code>TARGET</code>'s bounding box, while also excluding from capture any of the content
          that is not a DOM-descendant.

        <h3>Practical Use-Case #1: Recording part of an app</h3>
        <p>
          Consider an "editor" Web application (text-editor, image-editor, slides-editor or
          video-editor). Such applications often include a main content area, surrounded by various
          toolbars, drop-down menus and widgets which allow the local user to edit the content in
          the main content area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes a Web application wishes to record only the main content area, and then either
          transmit it "live" to remote participants, or record it to disk. Such an application would
          not necessarily wish to expend storage, bandwidth, or remote participants' screen
          real-estate on anything outside of the main content area.
        </p>
        <p>
          A mechanism such as [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] helps with cropping to the
          bounding box of the target-element, but what happens when drop-down lists temporarily draw
          over it?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="practical-use-case-2">
        <h3>Practical Use-Case #2: Collaborative tools during video-conferencing</h3>
        <p>
          Video-conferencing applications often arrange themselves using "tiles" - each remote
          participant's video is presented in a tile. Assume that a collaborative Web application,
          like a text editor or an image-editing application, is loaded in another iframe, and that
          this iframe is also presented as a tile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some remote participants would similarly load the same tool in a dedicated tile. But what
          if some users don't have the necessary permissions to load that tool? Or if they are
          joining from a platform that does not support the tool?
        </p>
        <p>
          The video conferencing solution may then choose to have one of the participants who have
          loaded the tool successfully screen-share that tool's tile to the users who cannot load
          the tool, allowing them to at least view it, although not interact with it. This can be
          done using self-capture through {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} and
          [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]].
        </p>
        <p>
          But such a solution introduces some problems. What happens if other elements ever draw on
          top of the tool tile, either briefly or permanently? Examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Private messages sent inside of the video-conferencing application.</li>
          <li>Requests by new users to join.</li>
          <li>Other tiles during tile-layout changes.</li>
          <li>Drop-down lists from other elements of the video-conferencing application.</li>

      <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
      <p>The Element Capture mechanism comprises two parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          [=RestrictionTarget production=]: A mechanism for <dfn>tagging</dfn> an {{Element}} as a
          potential target for the [=restriction mechanism=].
        </li>
        <li>
          [=Restriction mechanism=]: A mechanism for instructing the user agent to start restricting
          a video track to the bounding box of a previously [=tagging|tagged=] {{Element}}, or to
          stop such restriction and revert a track to its [=unrestricted=] state.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We define two <dfn>restriction-states</dfn>. <dfn>restricted</dfn> and
        <dfn>unrestricted</dfn>. Video tracks are always in one state or the other. Tracks start out
        [=unrestricted=], and may turn to [=restricted=] when
        {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo()}} is successfully called.

        <h3>Motivation for defining RestrictionTarget</h3>
        <p>
          The [=restriction mechanism=] presented in this document
          ({{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo}}) relies on a {{RestrictionTarget}} token
          rather than on direct node references. This allows restriction by one document to a target
          element specified in another document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo()}} and
          {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo()}} use different token types - {{CropTarget}}
          and {{RestrictionTarget}}, respectively - it is possible for documents to limit the
          capabilities they bestow on documents that capture them.

        <h3><dfn>RestrictionTarget</dfn> Definition</h3>
        <p>
          RestrictionTarget is an intentionally empty, opaque identifier. Its purpose is to be
          handed to {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo}} as input.

              Calling {{RestrictionTarget/fromElement}} with an {{Element}} of a supported type
              associates that {{Element}} with a {{RestrictionTarget}}. This {{RestrictionTarget}}
              may be used as input to {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo}}. We define a
              valid RestrictionTarget as one returned by a call to
              {{RestrictionTarget.fromElement()}} in a
              <a data-cite="!HTML#document">document</a> that is still
              <a data-cite="!HTML#active-document">active</a>.

            <p>
              When {{RestrictionTarget/fromElement}} is called with a given <var>element</var>, the
              user agent [=create a RestrictionTarget|creates a RestrictionTarget=] with
              <var>element</var> as input. The user agent MUST return a {{Promise}} <var>p</var>.
              The user agent MUST resolve <var>p</var> only after it has finished all the necessary
              internal propagation of state associated with the new {{RestrictionTarget}}, at which
              point the user agent MUST be ready to receive the new {{RestrictionTarget}} as a valid
              parameter to {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo}}.

            <p>
              When cloning an {{Element}} on which {{RestrictionTarget/fromElement}} was previously
              called, the clone is not associated with any {{RestrictionTarget}}. If
              {{RestrictionTarget/fromElement}} is later called on the clone, a new
              {{RestrictionTarget}} will be assigned to it.

                a {{RestrictionTarget}} constructor that accepts an {{Element}} as input. This is

      <p>
        Whenever the user agent is about to produce a new <var>frame</var> for a video track
        <var>T</var> that is [=restricted=] to a given target <var>RestrictionTarget</var>, the user
        agent MUST execute the following algorithm:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>E</var> be <var>RestrictionTarget</var>.{{RestrictionTarget/[[Element]]}}.</li>
        <li>
          If <var>E</var> is not a [=valid restriction target=] for <var>T</var>, abort without
          producing a new frame.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let <var>intersection</var> be the intersection of <var>E</var>'s bounding box and the
          captured surface's [=top-level browsing context=]'s viewport.
        </li>
        <li>If <var>intersection</var> is empty, abort without producing a new frame.</li>
        <li>
          A corollary of previous steps is that <var>E</var> forms a stacking context. Produce and
          deliver a frame consisting of an independent rendering of that stacking context, clipped
          to <var>intersection</var>.
