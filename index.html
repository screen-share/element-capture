      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Pre-existing mechanisms such as {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} allow Web applications to
        initiate screen-capture. If the user chooses to capture a tab, mechanisms such as
        [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] mutate the resulting video track and perform an
        operation on all subsequent frames produced. (In the example of [[mediacapture-region|Region
        Capture]], the operation consists of cropping frames to the frame's intersection with the
        bounding box of a target-element.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Element Capture introduces a new mutation mechanism which we name "restriction". When an
        application "restricts" a video track to a given target-element, frames produced on the
        restricted video track only consist of information from the target-element and its
        descendants. Phrased differently, the track becomes a capture of the DOM sub-tree rooted at
        the target-element.

        <h3>Generic Use-Case</h3>
        <p>
          [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] allows applications to crop captures. Assume some
          element <code>TARGET</code> is the restriction-target. What if other elements, which are
          not DOM-descendants of <code>TARGET</code>, draw in front of <code>TARGET</code>? Using
          [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]], these other elements would also get captured,
          which is not always desirable. A mechanism is sought that would allow cropping to
          <code>TARGET</code>'s bounding box, while also excluding from capture any of the content
          that is not a DOM-descendant.

        <h3>Practical Use-Case #1: Recording part of an app</h3>
        <p>
          Consider an "editor" Web application (text-editor, image-editor, slides-editor or
          video-editor). Such applications often include a main content area, surrounded by various
          toolbars, drop-down menus and widgets which allow the local user to edit the content in
          the main content area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes a Web application wishes to record only the main content area, and then either
          transmit it "live" to remote participants, or record it to disk. Such an application would
          not necessarily wish to expend storage, bandwidth, or remote participants' screen
          real-estate on anything outside of the main content area.
        </p>
        <p>
          A mechanism such as [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] helps with cropping to the
          bounding box of the target-element, but what happens when drop-down lists temporarily draw
          over it?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="practical-use-case-2">
        <h3>Practical Use-Case #2: Collaborative tools during video-conferencing</h3>
        <p>
          Video-conferencing applications often arrange themselves using "tiles" - each remote
          participant's video is presented in a tile. Assume that a collaborative Web application,
          like a text editor or an image-editing application, is loaded in another iframe, and that
          this iframe is also presented as a tile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some remote participants would similarly load the same tool in a dedicated tile. But what
          if some users don't have the necessary permissions to load that tool? Or if they are
          joining from a platform that does not support the tool?
        </p>
        <p>
          The video conferencing solution may then choose to have one of the participants who have
          loaded the tool successfully screen-share that tool's tile to the users who cannot load
          the tool, allowing them to at least view it, although not interact with it. This can be
          done using self-capture through {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} and
          [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]].
        </p>
        <p>
          But such a solution introduces some problems. What happens if other elements ever draw on
          top of the tool tile, either briefly or permanently? Examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Private messages sent inside of the video-conferencing application.</li>
          <li>Requests by new users to join.</li>
          <li>Other tiles during tile-layout changes.</li>
          <li>Drop-down lists from other elements of the video-conferencing application.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
      <p>The Element Capture mechanism comprises two parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          [=RestrictionTarget production=]: A mechanism for <dfn>tagging</dfn> an {{Element}} as a
          potential target for the [=restriction mechanism=].
        </li>
        <li>
          [=Restriction mechanism=]: A mechanism for instructing the user agent to start restricting
          a video track to the bounding box of a previously [=tagging|tagged=] {{Element}}, or to
          stop such restriction and revert a track to its [=unrestricted=] state.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We define two <dfn>restriction-states</dfn>. <dfn>restricted</dfn> and
        <dfn>unrestricted</dfn>. Video tracks are always in one state or the other. Tracks start out
        [=unrestricted=], and may turn to [=restricted=] when
        {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo()}} is successfully called.

        <h3>Motivation for defining RestrictionTarget</h3>
        <p>
          The [=restriction mechanism=] presented in this document
          ({{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo}}) relies on a {{RestrictionTarget}} token
          rather than on direct node references. This allows restriction by one document to a target
          element specified in another document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo()}} and
          {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo()}} use different token types - {{CropTarget}}
          and {{RestrictionTarget}}, respectively - it is possible for documents to limit the
          capabilities they bestow on documents that capture them.

        <p>
          RestrictionTarget is an intentionally empty, opaque identifier. Its purpose is to be
          handed to {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo}} as input.

            <p>
              Calling {{RestrictionTarget/fromElement}} with an {{Element}} of a supported type
              associates that {{Element}} with a {{RestrictionTarget}}. This {{RestrictionTarget}}
              may be used as input to {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo}}. We define a
              valid RestrictionTarget as one returned by a call to
              {{RestrictionTarget.fromElement()}} in a
              <a data-cite="!HTML#document">document</a> that is still

              agent [=create a RestrictionTarget|creates a RestrictionTarget=] with |element| as
              input. The user agent MUST return a {{Promise}} |p|. The user agent MUST resolve |p|
              only after it has finished all the necessary internal propagation of state associated
              with the new {{RestrictionTarget}}, at which point the user agent MUST be ready to
              receive the new {{RestrictionTarget}} as a valid parameter to
              {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo}}.
            </p>
            <p>
              When cloning an {{Element}} on which {{RestrictionTarget/fromElement}} was previously
              called, the clone is not associated with any {{RestrictionTarget}}. If
              {{RestrictionTarget/fromElement}} is later called on the clone, a new
              {{RestrictionTarget}} will be assigned to it.

      <h2><dfn>Applying the restriction transformation</dfn></h2>
      <p>
        Whenever the user agent is about to produce a new |frame| for a video track |T| that is
        [=restricted=] to a given target |restrictionTarget|, the user agent MUST execute the
        following algorithm:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Let |E| be |restrictionTarget|.{{RestrictionTarget/[[Element]]}}.</li>
        <li>
          If |E| is not a [=valid restriction target=] for |T|, abort without producing a new frame.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let |intersection| be the intersection of |E|'s bounding box and the captured surface's
          [=top-level browsing context=]'s viewport.
        </li>
        <li>If |intersection| is empty, abort without producing a new frame.</li>
        <li>
          A corollary of previous steps is that |E| forms a stacking context. Produce and deliver a
          frame consisting of an independent rendering of that stacking context, clipped to
          |intersection|.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The frame produced in the final step is constructed by rendering |E| and its descendants
        over an infinite transparent canvas, positioned so that the edges of the
        <a data-cite="!css-images-4#decorated-bounding-box">decorated bounding box</a> are flush
        with the edges of the frame.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        In some implementations, the underlying pixel format for the frame data will not be able to
        carry alpha channel information. In this case, the implementation can blend the rendered
        frame with an infinite canvas of black (`rgb(0,0,0)`).
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Implementations may either re-use existing bitmap data generated for |E| or regenerate the
        display of the element to maximize quality at the frame's size (for example, if the
        implementation detects that the referenced element is an SVG fragment). However, the frame
        must look identical to |E| as rendered above, modulo rasterization quality.

        <h2>Benefits of this API</h2>
        <p>
          For non-malicious applications, the APIs introduced by this specifications should be a
          pure positive, as they allow responsible applications to pare down the information
          recorded. This has positive properties.
        </p>
        <p>For example, using pre-existing mechanisms, video-conferencing applications can:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Embed content in an iframe.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prompt the user to capture the current tab. (Using
              {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}}.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Crop the resulting capture to just the iframe that's intended for capture. (Using
              {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo()}}.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Transmit the resulting pixels to remote participants. (Using
              <a data-cite="webrtc#dom-rtcpeerconnection">RTCPeerConnection</a>.)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          However, this is risky, because any content that happens to be drawn in front of the
          content intended for capture will also be transmitted remotely. Even if this happens but
          briefly, remote users might notice. And such content might be highly private - for
          example, chat notifications, reminders, speaker notes...
        </p>
        <p>
          The mechanisms introduced in this specification allow a responsible application to
          structure itself in a way that would completely guarantee that such issues are impossible.
          Such an application can more easily make and keep privacy guarantees to its users.

        <h2>Concerns about this API</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Reading cross-origin pixels</h3>
          <p>
            The mechanisms introduced by this specification all rely on self-capture being provided
            by some other means - typically {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}}. The main concern
            with these, is that they allow an application read-access to cross-origin content.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a malicious application tricks the user to approve self-capture, it can then load
            cross-origin content in an invisible iframe and then bring the content to the forefront,
            allowing the attacker to read the content before the user can react. Such attacks are
            already possible without any of the mechanisms introduced by this specification.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Aggravating old attack vectors</h3>
          <p>
            The main concern is that the mechanisms we introduce in this specification should not
            <b>aggravate</b> the old attack vectors described above. One naturally worries that the
            mechanisms we introduce allow the old attacks to be carried out <b>surreptitiously</b>.
            We contend that the mechanisms introduced here do not increase an attacker's power to
            hide the attack; such attack-concealment was always possible using any of the following
            techniques:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Displaying the content briefly.</b> Attackers could always flash content to the
                screen for a timespan of a single frame. This is long enough to record it, but not
                long enough for users to understand it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Displaying the content piecemeal.</b> Attackers could always display break the
                content up into multiple small pieces, even one pixel each, and display them in
                different locations and times. Users would not be able to observe this manipulation,
                but it is trivial for software to collect these pixels and reconstruct a picture
                from it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Displaying the content at low opacity.</b> Attackers could always display content
                at an opacity that is imperceptible for a user, but which machines can still read.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Any of these techniques is enough on its own, but through a combination of them,
            malicious applications were always able to conceal their attacks effectively and still
            read content efficiently.

          <h3>Reading occluded content</h3>
          <p>
            One might worry that a malicious app be able to remove occlusions in cross-origin
            iframes, without opt-in from that content. The shape of the API prevents such attacks -
            the cross-origin iframe would have to produce a {{RestrictionTarget}} and pass it to the
            would-be attacker. As {{RestrictionTargets}} serve no purpose other than as part of the
            API introduced by this specification, the minting and passing of a {{RestrictionTarget}}
            proves the cross-origin iframe's permission for its occlusions to be removed.

        <section>
          <h3>Interaction with Region Capture</h3>
          <p>
            In designing the APIs introduced by this specification, a conscious decision was made to
            not reuse {{CropTarget}}, and define a dedicated token instead ({{CropTarget}}). This
            ensures that any existing Web applications that have previously been designed and
            implemented with {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/cropTo()}} in mind, but not with
            {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo()}}, would not be effectively opting into
            allowing occlusions to be removed, as described in the
            <a href="#reading-occluded-content">previous section</a>.
